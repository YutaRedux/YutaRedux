# 👋 Hi, I’m @YutaRedux!
🐍 I develop in **Python**, but currently learning **Node.js** and **C#**.  
👨🏽‍💻 I make backend APIs with **Flask** and **FastAPI + Uvicorn**, using **MySQL** and **SQLite** as databases.  
✈ I also have experience working with [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) and [OpenTele](https://github.com/thedemons/opentele) to create Telegram software.  
🍏 I'm also an **Apple** fan. I love their aesthetic design and user experience approach, their ecosystem, their services, etc.  
📕 In my spare time, I read programming books, Apple's guidelines, articles on Habr and play games.  
🥔 Science is not about WHY, it's about WHY NOT!  
📐 NEROVNO!!!
